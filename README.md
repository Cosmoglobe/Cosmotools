Sup nerds! If you want this to run on the owls after compiling, remember that the old libraries which the executables are trying to point
to exist at /mn/stornext/u3/hke/owl/local/lib

HK probably will grill me for this, but to run, be sure to run
  `export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/mn/stornext/u3/hke/owl/local/lib:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH`
in terminal before trying to use!

Cheers!
